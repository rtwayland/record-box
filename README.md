# Record Box

This web app helps a user view and manage their personal record collection.

All records will be displayed in a list. As the user scrolls, more records will be loaded and displayed when reaching the bottom of the page.

New records can be added by clicking the "add" button at the top right of the screen.

Records can be edited by hovering the mouse over the desired album cover and clicking the "edit" (pencil) button.

Likewise, records can be deleted after hovering over the album cover and clicking the "delete" (trash) button.

If the user changes the name of the album artist, all other records associated with that artist will have their artist name updated as well.

Finally, all records can be searched by either their album title or artist name in the top search bar. The artist's name can be clicked on each album cover to quickly run a search for that specific artist.

Enjoy!
